Tips
Use old-fashioned rolled oats instead of quick-cooking rolled oats.

Instead of raisins, use your favorite dried fruit. Try dried apricots, blueberries, cherries, cranberries, chopped dates or figs, or mixed fruit bits.

Oatmeal cookies freeze well. Transfer the cooled cookies to airtight containers and freeze them for up to six months. For grab-and-go desserts and snacks freeze two or three cookies each in resealable plastic freezer storage bags.
